- Autoembeds your PDF attachments with Google PDF viewer
- Saves a copy of your PDF attachment in the "images/pdf" folder automatically created on purpose.
- The embedded PDF can be viewed full-screen on a new tab/window with a click of a button.
- Once disabled your PDF attachments revert to the native behaviour.
- Works with HTTP and HTTPS.
